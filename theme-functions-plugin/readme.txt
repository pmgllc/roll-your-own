Adds a theme-dependent area to add functions that must be preserved if the theme is changed (i.e., CPTs).

== Description ==

Protect your dashboard with a game-changing authorization code. The login form will never be the same again.

= Why it exists =

Because ThemeForest continues to push out themes with a crap-ton of features in their themes that all disappear when an unsuspecting user changes themes.

== Installation ==

1. Upload contents of the directory to /wp-content/plugins/ (or use the automatic installer)
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Paste a function or whole crap-ton of functions into theme-functions.php. If you're doing this, you should be someone who knows what the flip you're doing.
1. No cowboy coding, people.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is the UI? =

There is no UI. If you're using this, then you're either a developer or advanced user. Paste a function directly into the only PHP file in the plugin. Save. Upload. Refresh the admin or front-end. It's just like adding a function to functions.php but NOT in the theme.

== Screenshots ==

There's nothing to show. Really.
